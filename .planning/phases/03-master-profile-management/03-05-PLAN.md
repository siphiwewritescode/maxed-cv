<objective>
Build the Skills tag input section and the three simpler CRUD sections: Education, Projects, and Certifications. These follow the patterns established by the Experience section but are simpler (no nested bullet points, no complex drag-and-drop).

Purpose: Completes all remaining profile sections. Skills is unique (tag-based with autocomplete). Education/Projects/Certifications share a similar card+modal pattern.
Output: Four fully functional profile sections ready for integration into the wizard and profile view.

  <action>
**SkillsTagInput.tsx** - Tag input component per user decision:
- Text input field where user types a skill name
- As user types, show dropdown of suggestions from `suggestSkills()` (from lib/skills-database.ts)
- Suggestions appear below the input in a dropdown list (max 5 suggestions)
- User can click a suggestion or press Enter to add the skill
- When adding: run `normalizeSkill()` to convert abbreviations (e.g., "JS" -> "JavaScript")
- Prevent duplicates: if skill already exists in the list, don't add again (case-insensitive check)
- Each added skill appears as a tag/chip (use shadcn/ui Badge component) with an X button to remove
- Skills can be reordered via drag-and-drop (use dnd-kit SortableContext with the shared SortableItem)
- No mandatory proficiency levels or categories per user decision
- Keyboard navigation: arrow keys to navigate suggestions, Enter to select, Escape to close dropdown

Props:
- skills: ProfileSkill[] (current skills)
- onSkillsChange: (skills: { name: string, order: number }[]) => void
- Debounce the suggestions query slightly (150ms) to avoid excessive filtering

**SkillsSection.tsx** - Section wrapper:
- Section header: "Skills" with no add button (adding is done via the tag input)
- Renders SkillsTagInput component
- On skills change: call `profileAPI.updateSkills(newSkills)` to persist
- Debounce the save slightly (500ms after last change) to avoid rapid API calls during quick edits
- Show save indicator: "Saving..." while API call is in progress, brief "Saved" after success
- Empty state: show SkillsTagInput with placeholder text "Start typing to add skills (e.g., JavaScript, Python, AWS...)"
- Per user decision: skills displayed as tags/chips, can add, remove, reorder

The tag input can be built with standard HTML input + custom dropdown (no need for react-tag-autocomplete library). Using the built-in suggestSkills function from skills-database.ts provides the autocomplete data.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Typing "java" in input shows suggestions including "JavaScript" and "Java"
2. Typing "js" shows "JavaScript" as suggestion (via alias normalization)
3. Selecting a suggestion adds it as a tag/chip
4. Clicking X on a tag removes it
5. Adding a duplicate skill is prevented
6. Skills persist to backend after changes (with debounced save)
7. Tags can be reordered via drag-and-drop
  </verify>
  <done>
Skills section with autocomplete tag input, canonical normalization (JS->JavaScript), duplicate prevention, tag display with remove, drag-and-drop reordering, and debounced auto-save to backend.

These three sections follow the same pattern as ExperienceSection but simpler (no nested bullet points). Reuse DeleteConfirmDialog and SortableItem from shared components.

**EducationSection.tsx + EducationFormDialog.tsx:**
- Section header: "Education" with "+ Add Education" button
- Empty state: graduation cap icon, "No education entries yet", "Add your educational background"
- Cards show: institution (bold), degree + field of study, date range
- Modal form fields (using educationSchema):
  1. Institution (text, required)
  2. Degree (text, required, e.g., "Bachelor of Science")
  3. Field of Study (text, optional, e.g., "Computer Science")
  4. Start Date (month/year)
  5. End Date (month/year, optional)
- CRUD: add, edit (click card), delete (with confirmation)
- Drag-and-drop reordering using SortableItem + DndContext
- On reorder: call `profileAPI.reorderSection('education', items)`

**ProjectsSection.tsx + ProjectFormDialog.tsx:**
- Section header: "Projects" with "+ Add Project" button
- Empty state: code/rocket icon, "No projects yet", "Showcase your personal or professional projects"
- Cards show: project name (bold), description (truncated), technology tags (as badges), URL link
- Modal form fields (using projectSchema):
  1. Project Name (text, required)
  2. Description (textarea, optional, max 1000 chars)
  3. Technologies Used (tag-like input, simple comma-separated or multi-input, stored as string array)
  4. URL (text, optional, validated as URL when provided)
- CRUD + drag-and-drop reordering

**CertificationsSection.tsx + CertificationFormDialog.tsx:**
- Section header: "Certifications" with "+ Add Certification" button
- Empty state: award/certificate icon, "No certifications yet", "Add professional certifications to strengthen your profile"
- Cards show: certification name (bold), issuer, issue date, credential ID if present
- Modal form fields (using certificationSchema):
  1. Certification Name (text, required, e.g., "AWS Solutions Architect")
  2. Issuer (text, required, e.g., "Amazon Web Services")
  3. Issue Date (month/year, optional)
  4. Credential ID (text, optional)
- CRUD + drag-and-drop reordering

**Shared patterns across all three:**
- Use shadcn/ui Dialog for modals, Form for forms, Badge for tags
- Use React Hook Form with zodResolver for each section's schema
- Loading state on Save button while API call is in progress
- Inline form errors via FormMessage
- Optimistic or callback-based list refresh after CRUD operations
- Reuse DeleteConfirmDialog from shared/ for delete confirmations
- Reuse SortableItem from shared/ for drag-and-drop
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Each section renders empty state when no entries
2. Add button opens modal form for each section
3. Form validation works (required fields, URL format for projects)
4. Saving creates entries, editing updates them, deleting removes them
5. Cards display correct information
6. Drag-and-drop reordering works for all three sections
7. No TypeScript compilation errors
  </verify>
  <done>
Education, Projects, and Certifications sections complete with card display, modal add/edit forms, delete confirmation, drag-and-drop reordering, and empty states. All sections follow consistent patterns and reuse shared components.
  </done>
</task>

<verification>
1. Skills tag input shows autocomplete suggestions and adds tags
2. Skills normalization converts abbreviations to canonical names
3. Education/Projects/Certifications each have working CRUD via modals
4. All sections show appropriate empty states
5. Drag-and-drop reordering works across all sections
6. All CRUD operations persist to backend via API
7. Validation errors display properly in all forms
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Skills section: autocomplete from 70+ skills, alias normalization, tag display, reordering, auto-save
- Education section: card display, modal CRUD, date range fields, reordering
- Projects section: card display with tech tags, modal CRUD, URL validation, reordering
- Certifications section: card display, modal CRUD, credential ID field, reordering
- All sections use shared DeleteConfirmDialog and SortableItem
- No duplicate code between sections (shared patterns extracted)
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-master-profile-management/03-05-SUMMARY.md`
